Notes
-----------
- due to complications with JSON.NET nuget packaging interacting badly with the ahead-of-time compilation used for Xamarin.iOS, this project does NOT reference the JSON.NET nuget package because NuGet will pick the wrong platform target. The direct reference to the portable-sl4-etc version of JSON.NET is deliberate. This has apparently been fixed in the JSON.NET 6.0.1 package but we have not updated the entire SDK to use this version yet.
- due to bugs in the HttpClient NuGet package, there are various VS warnings around assembly binding redirects. This project (and all iOS projects that use our SDK) needs to have the assembly binding redirect for System.Net.Http to v2.5.0.0 (the mono version). If it has assembly binding redirects to System.Net.Http.Primitives or Extensions, bad things can happen, and VS will try to auto generate these in some situations so watch out.
